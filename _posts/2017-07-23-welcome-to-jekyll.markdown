Today I learned how to set up a simple site with Jekyll on GitHub Pages.

The _easy_ way to make it is to [Jekyll theme](https://jekyll-themes.com) repository and update the `_config.yml` file with your information.

Personally, I've chosen [Cayman](https://jekyll-themes.com/cayman/).

The few problem that I encoutered is that certains files need to be in the repository to be executed well, those are :

- `_layouts`(!);
- `_includes`;

I also noted that GitHub Pages is case sensitive that's why I changed repository name from `TIL` to `til`.
